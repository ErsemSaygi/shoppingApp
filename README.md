# SHOPPING APP
This project is a simple application that includes many modern android libraries. The application consists of a list of products and a page with the details of these products.

## Technologies Used

**Room:** The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

**Glide:** Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library for Android focused on smooth scrolling. Glide offers an easy to use API, a performant and extensible resource decoding pipeline and automatic resource pooling.

**Coroutines:** A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

**Live-Data:** LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

**Retrofit:** Retrofit is a library for making HTTP requests and interacting with RESTful APIs in Android applications.

**DataBinding:** The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

**Rx-Java:** RxJava is a Java library for asynchronous and event-driven programming.
